# Natural Language Query Executor (NLQE)

Natural Language Query Executor (NLQE) is a full-stack application that enables users to query a MySQL database using plain English instead of writing SQL. It bridges the gap between non-technical users and databases by converting natural language questions into accurate, executable SQL queries in a secure and structured way.

The goal of this project is to make data access simple, intuitive, and accessible without requiring prior SQL knowledge.
